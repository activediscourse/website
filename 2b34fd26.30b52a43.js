Throughout 2019, I decided to dig into iOS development more and more. At the end of the year, I wanted to make my iOS development a little bit more legitimate by migrating off my Hackintosh build onto a proper Mac. The general consensus on Reddit is that a MacBook is recommended for App development, the main driving factor is mobility. Unfortunately, I don't understand that perspective. I have an office and I've molded it to serve me perfectly. The Mac Mini has more power per dollar than a MacBook Pro, plus all the tools I've amassed over my Hackintosh years translate 1:1 to the Mac Mini.

As you'll hear me talk about on Active Discourse, it was on sale and I was never going to buy this full price.

Let's address the storage here and never talk about it again."),Object(n.b)("p",null,"Simply put, I opted for the 1TB model for future proofing. The base model had 128GB at the time, that was never going to happen and is ridiculous in 2019, I'm glad Apple got rid of that size for their Mac's in 2020. 256GB was ruled out for closely related reasons. 512GB was heavily considered, but on my Hackintosh I ever so slightly run into storage issues already. One solution if I wanted to make 512GB work would be to have an external drive hang off the back of it immediately and forever...

In the below section about heat, I tinkered with iStat Menus and with more aggressive fan rules, sustaining close to 4.1ghz under-load indefinitely is possible. In a handbrake test compressing a 1080p video, the Mac Mini was loud, but able to sustain 4.1ghz through the whole convert and quickly quieted down after the conversion completed."),Object(n.b)("p",null,"One of the primary functions of this Mac will be to run Xcode, build times and simulator launches are at least 50-75% faster than my previous computer (Core i5-6500, 4 cores at 3.5ghz).

My previous desktop computer was a custom build, my computer before that was a iMac 27\u201d (2011) which I tried to upgrade the HDD to an SSD and I broke it... That experiment taught me I need a computer that I can open without worry. Fast forward to the Mac Mini. While it is more daunting to upgrade the RAM, I was comfortable with it due to extensive tinkering in my life. While I walk away with a sense of accomplishment by avoiding the Apple RAM tax, I\u2019m frustrated that the RAM upgrade process was so hard.

For example, attaching an external NVM.e solid state drive actually has the capability to perform faster than the built in storage.

The GPU has it\u2019s own dedicated vRAM, but it also taps into a small amount of the system RAM as well. While the 8GB RAM was installed, my dual 4K displays had frequent frame rate issues. Specifically, triggering animations and transparency caused frame rate drops. This was upsetting and could have inspired me to return the Mac Mini. But once the 32GB upgrade was completed, the frame drop issues were reduced. Most animations are smooth, the transparency doesn\u2019t tax the system, and Affinity Designer/Publisher run fine. Affinity Photo runs better than Photoshop on this Mac Mini, that is thanks to Affinity taking advantage of Apple's Metal API. But editing RAW photos is a poor experience on this Mac Mini. You can do it, but even simple edits to RAW photos will take longer than you'd like. Zooming and panning on a photo overburdens the GPU immediately and causes stutter. These issues weren't as bad when editing JPG's. But I shoot in RAW and I found myself editing photos on my iPad and then migrating the edits back to my Mac.

While I was nervous about that, I bought the Core i7 model any way.
