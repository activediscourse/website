# I am going to Keep my Facebook profile

Let's start this conversation with a question. When you don't trust a friend, how do you expect them to behave? Irrationally, right? Facebook is an untrustworthy friend that has proven to be dangerous and is increasingly a liability in many of our lives. So what do you do with an untrustworthy friend? You create distance, you create reduce your dependency on them, and eventually you sever ties completely.

In early 2018, after I had posted all of the updates and thank you's from my Wedding, I decided to put Facebook on pause in my life. I didn't want to delete my profile for 3 very important reasons.

<!--truncate-->

1. Like an untrustworthy friend, do you really expect Facebook to *actually* delete your profile? As it stands, the process to delete your profile is wildly complicated and full of traps to reactivate it. But further, they are an untrustworthy company, this has been demonstrated time and time again. Thereis absolutely no way you can prove they deleted your profile. You have their word, but what is that really worth?

2. I don't trust Facebook to delete my profile, so now I have an albatross to carry for the rest my life. But how valuable is my profile if the data is out of date? I wager, every day I don't use Facebook, the value of my data is less and less. I am not sharing details about my life, I am not putting much time or effort into viewing posts, I don't spend any time on their advertisements (there's a bigger deal!)... the value of my data is degrading. Facebook is smart, they have ways to get new data on me without using their website. But nothing is easier, cheaper, or more valuable than being actively engaged with their service. So if they won't delete my data, at least I can maintain control of it and feel better that it is degrading.

3. Lastly, let's get a little more positive. Information on my profile contains my history. For 10 years of my life, pretty much every thought I had was posted to Facebook. Many of those thoughts were dumb, but it is fun to reminisce on a younger me. And while at this point, I am a long way from trusting Facebook, I am nostalgic and hope that they can become a trustworthy company again. How they can accomplish that is a very different article.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this and I'm sure we'll discuss this at length over the course of 2020 on our Podcast. For now, I'll take any tips or tricks on how to kill the spiders Facebook spawned around the web to keep tabs on my life.
