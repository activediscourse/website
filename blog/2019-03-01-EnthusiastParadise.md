# The Enthusiast Paradise

Since there are very few posts to this website so far, it may not be obvious yet, but I am a technology enthusiast. Everyone has their thing and my thing is electronics. 

As I write to you today, I find myself a bit perplexed. The technology I have in my life is perfectly fine and yet I just spent half an hour scouring several online shops looking to buy new technology. Today in particular, I was looking at buying a nice large monitor to replace the 2 medium sized monitors currently occupying my desk. But on other days laptops are on the menu, maybe a new vacuum, or maybe I could buy a new phone today and hand down my perfectly fine phone to my wife. But almost always, after 30 - 120 minutes of digging something comes up and puts the whole thing on hold. Something comes up and casts doubt on the whole thought, only to be forgotten within 1-7 days. 

In a moment of clarity, this whole cycle seems like madness. And if you pick apart my hobby of choice, you will very likely confirm my insanity. But I do implore you to think about your own hobby in this light. How much effort do you put in to get better at your hobby? How much time and/or money do you sink in and how much do you get back out of it? If you love your hobby, you get endless enjoyment and the effort required feels miniscule.
